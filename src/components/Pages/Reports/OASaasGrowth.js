          and activation are the most powerful (and cost-effective) levers for
          boosting long-term retention and revenue. Discover how optimizing
          these critical stages can drastically reduce churn, increase customer
          lifetime value, and accelerate growth. Download the full report to
          uncover the strategies top SaaS companies use to turn new users into
          loyal, paying customers.
