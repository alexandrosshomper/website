        In this case study we‚Äôll take a look at asana‚Äôs onboarding and activation
        flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we‚Äôve identified two use cases (Personal Task Management and Team
        Collaboration), the case study reveals a strong bias towards the team use
        case, occasionally at the expense of individual users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asana has clearly positioned itself towards enterprise and team
        collaboration, which is reflected throughout their user onboarding
        journey. This strategic focus impacts everything from landing page
        messaging, signup, to activation metrics.
      </p>
      <p>Let‚Äôs take a look.</p>

      <h3>Landingpage</h3>
      <p>
        Asana is a versatile project management tool that does not want to be
        put in one specific use.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the website homepage it positions itself as a tool to connect any type
        of work with each other. This positioning is mainly focused on the buyer,
        the exec. They make the decision to purchase Asana on a big plan. For the
        actual users of Asana this positioning is very vague. Common for products
        with versatile use cases and aiming for enterprise customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the exec comes in very late in the funnel. Most likely a low-mid
        level employee is the driving force, researching tools, advocating to
        their managers, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which is why Asana provides many landing pages and positionings for the
        different functions in a corporate. Marketing, Sales, Dev, HR, etc. which
        they can now afford compared to when they started ‚Äî because
        multi-positioning &amp; GTM is complex and costly.
      </p>
      <CaseImage
        imgURL="/img/case_studies/asana/Fletch-horizontal-positioning-landingpage.png"
        size="S"
      />
      <p>So, what could Asana do better?</p>
      <p>
        On the design side, the above the fold is very monotone. The CTA kind of
        blends in with the design. If everything has the same color, nothing is
        emphasized.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder about the engagement and success KPI for the chatbot, as it is
        very distracting and overlapping.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Asana could also leverage its multi-positioning. It could use the
        landing page as a source for personalizing the onboarding flow. For
        example reiterating the USP for marketing on the first signup screen when
        the user came from the marketing landing page.
      </p>

      <h3>Segmentation &amp; Profiling</h3>
      <p>Move certain profiling questions to post-commitment phase.</p>

      <h3>Personalization</h3>
      <p>Leverage segmentation data to offer personalized templates and experiences.</p>

      <h3>Plan Selection</h3>
      <p>Provide clearer communication about trial period and feature limitations.</p>

      <h3>Persona &amp; Product Market Fit</h3>
      <p>
        Create a more streamlined experience for personal users while maintaining
        team functionality.
      </p>

      <h3>First Experience</h3>
      <p>First screen is overloaded, personal users may feel overwhelmed by enterprise-focused features.</p>

      <h3>Activation</h3>
      <p>Activation heavily dependent on team participation.</p>
